About:
  The main objective of this project is to create a customer service experience by recording the conversation with a customer service representative. This is achieved through the usage of node.js and firebase for the backend development and markup languages for front-end development. In addition, IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding (NLU) API was intelligently used in order to interpret the transcript between the interaction of customer and a representative of the corresponding area of assistance.
